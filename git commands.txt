git clone to make a local copy from GitHub

git add to track changes, like an added file

git config for metadata like name and email

git commit to commit the changes (with a -sm signed message)

git push to push local changes back to GitHub

The 6th essential git command is:

git pull to get any changes made on GitHub back to the local copy (without having to start from scratch with a new clone)
